feedback:

Pen/paper: You didn’t do forward pass. In the second line, dy_hat/dz_2 is 1, not z2. Other than that it is all correct. (-0.5)

Calculation: The mistake above messed up all the calculations. But except of that you understood how it works so I won’t deduct points.

Relu: the gradient where z is positive is 1, not z. (-0.5)


well done!

Best,
